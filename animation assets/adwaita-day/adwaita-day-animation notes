New todo:

ok so

we need to start it so it continuously changes color, there's no point where it seems to stop.

the way we do this is:

- we extend each fade-out to be verrrrry long

- we start a new fade-in before the fade-out happens

- only in one occassion do we allow the fade-in to stop.


have continuos color changing by using large-scale noise on all the triangles between 0 and 0.2 opacity.
