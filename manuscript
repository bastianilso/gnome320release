GNOME is developing the free desktop of the next generation.
A platform, which provides a unified experience and is accessible for anyone.

GNOME's application core is continually maturing. New development in Files has enabled it to create and open archives. It's now also possible to rename multiple files at once in a single operation.
GNOME Software has received visual improvements with an improved landing page. This cycle also lands furhter integration for installing flatpak bundles and repositories.
Furthermore, GNOME Photos can share images through e-mail or google photos.

Major work is being undertaken to improve the desktop infrastructure.
GNOME is enhancing the desktop security by building sandboxing technology with GTK+, Flatpak and Wayland. 

With this release, developers can make use of this technology directly from GNOME Builder. From the revamped headerbar you can target autotools projects against a specific flatpak SDK. Builder also includes an application profiler to measure your application's performance.

The new release will be provided by many distributions soon. GNOME is developed in the open and a friendly place to start contributing to free software. You can help us push the free desktop further by getting involved today.



    GTK+ is getting portals support so sandboxed applications can get access on the fly through user permission.
    For more news follow GTK+'s blog which has weekly highlights.
