fmuellner	bastianilso__: congrats on the video!
bastianilso__: you should be eating cake ...

elliot	bastianilso__: Just saw 3.22 video, really nice job

csoriano	bastianilso__: I see. I'm surprised actually, we had few issues with autoar versioning... you must have been lucky :)

Seriously: very few commercial products have this kind of high quality videos and release notes. The engagement team volunteers are awesome.


ebassi  As usual, kudos for @Meshquick for the amazing video, and to @o0karen0o for her voice over.

abono__	thank you for another awesome video :)

@bastianilso btw, saw your release video. hvae to say you're getting better and better every time! have you thought about rendering it in 60fps, that's the only thing I really missed.
