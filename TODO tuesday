High level todo:
- watch draft through for errors (in progress)
- mark places where the soundtrack is interesting, or replace soundtrack.
- possibly need to extend the distribution animation since i dont know looks like karen is making that one longer...

TODO
- Fix the timing at the start

✓ no gaussian blur on the intro part.

✓ Start doing the triangle stuff earlier so it doesnt seem like it starts after the gnome logo or something i guess?  maybe slowly make it more prominent ie first have very low opacity then increase it.

- can maybe do the app overview for a longer time for sure. and maybe remove the outtro or replace with logarithmic fly-away.

✓ black frame between outtro of GSoC/Outreachy and the files intro

✓ 0:29 too quick fade from light color to normal color. also the files logo is still shown, it's probably better to let the light fade and the nautilus fade happen simultaneously.

✓ fade between compress-dialog and batch rename should be longer

✓ brief black frame between pressing install button on nightly repository and etc.

✓ the gnome games logo seems to lack a shadow when we zoom in, investigate why.

- Need to do more intense zooming on the builder window

18 outtro could be longer for the "the gnome community is friendly for anyone"
